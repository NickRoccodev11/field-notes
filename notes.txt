- add new component from simple-maps called MapFeedDisplay
    - MFD accepts an array of geo Markers and returns a ComposeableMap objects
- hook up component to the mapfeed 


TODO:

-need comments route on server.js, routes folder, comments controller, comment models
- new comments component
-recursive/subcommenting?
